This directory has two files

 * db.ini - this is the username and password for your mysql database.
   Please note to INTENTIONALLY OMIT THE SPACE surrounding the equals as this is used also by bash scripts and directly interpreted. (tricky tricky and also simple simple)

 * authkey - (you have to provide this yourself.) Place your authkey from google here.  Make it just a single line of the key.
   example:

    echo 'your key' > authkey
